$ docker tag 2bde2eb6e643 govinda/spring-boot-test1:spring-Boot
$ docker push govinda/spring-boot-test1 => output is look like this

Saving and loading images
Pushing to Docker Hub is great, but it does have some disadvantages:

Bandwidth - many ISPs have much lower upload bandwidth than download bandwidth.
Unless youâ€™re paying extra for the private repositories, pushing equals publishing.
When working on some clusters, each time you launch a job that uses a Docker container it pulls the container from Docker Hub, and if you are running many jobs, this can be really slow.
